# Manhattan Project for AI Safety: Connor Leahy

## 🧠 Core Thesis

Connor Leahy (Conjecture CEO) delivers a blistering critique of AI safety washing. OpenAI's "super-alignment" is just alignment; the original problem was always about superhuman systems, not nice chatbots. The industry has been gaslit into thinking friendly chat products equals alignment. Key insight: if tomorrow you have a system more powerful than the rest of the world combined, there is now a global dictator. What do you have it do? Our best answer is "western constitution with bells and whistles" and even that should terrify us. The labs' self-regulation is like Exxon promising their climate readiness framework will prevent oil drilling problems.

    The Safety Washing Problem
      OpenAI 1984'd alignment
      Called real problem super-alignment
      Original alignment was always about AGI
      Friendly chatbots is not alignment
    The Exxon Analogy
      Labs say trust our framework
      Like Exxon on climate change
      Foxes guarding hen house
      Why even listen to this?
    The Real Alignment Problem
      System more powerful than world
      Now global dictator
      What do you have it do?
      Best answer: western constitution
      Should terrify us
    What We Haven't Scienced
      Complex systems
      Objective human values
      Governance
      Public choice theory
      Game theory
      No standard definitions
      No objective measures
    The SF Scene
      Guy: don't care about children
      Counterfactual beings matter more
      F*** preferences of existing humans
      Girl: humanism = living in human bodies forever?
      Don't understand human values
    Ethical Humanism
      Not anthropocentric
      There is only us and sentient beings
      Either care for who's here
      Or care for non-existent things
    No Progress on Core Questions
      Don't know more about morals
      Don't know more about governance
      Don't know more about institutions
      Same as 5-10 years ago

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mechanisms

### 1. The 1984 of "Super-Alignment" (Complexity: 4 → ELI20)
*   **The Logic**: OpenAI renamed the original alignment problem "super-alignment" to distinguish from their chatbot safety work. But the original problem was always about aligning superhuman systems to human values. Having nice chatbots was never what alignment meant. This is PR rebranding an industry-scale gaslighting campaign.
*   **Concrete Example**: "OpenAI did a 1984 by talking about the OG alignment problem as super alignment. No, it's just alignment. That's what it literally meant. Having nice chatbots was not alignment."

### 2. The Exxon Mobile Analogy (Complexity: 3 → ELI30)
*   **The Logic**: Dario saying Anthropic can self-regulate with threat levels is like Exxon's top petrol engineers promising their climate readiness framework will handle their new oil well. They know more about oil than you, so trust them. Where is the cynicism? Where is the journalism? Why would you even listen to someone whose job is to lie to you?
*   **Concrete Example**: "I've been talking to top petrol engineers at Exxon Mobile and they've assured me their climate change preparedness framework will totally not be a problem."

### 3. The Global Dictator Problem (Complexity: 5 → ELI15)
*   **The Logic**: A big sub-problem of alignment: tomorrow you have a system more powerful than the rest of the world combined. There is now a global dictator. What do you have this global dictator do? Our best answer is western constitution with some bells and whistles. Even that should terrify us because we don't have a good answer.
*   **Concrete Example**: "If we're like this is now the world government forever, we'd be super afraid because we just do not have a good answer to that question."

### 4. Fields We Haven't "Scienced" (Complexity: 4 → ELI20)
*   **The Logic**: To solve alignment we need progress on: studying complex systems, systems more powerful than humans, objective human values, governance, public choice theory, game theory, sociology, psychology. We haven't solved these; we haven't even scienced them. No standard definitions, objective measures, or systematic indicators of progress.
*   **Concrete Example**: "It's not even that we haven't solved them. It's just we haven't scienced them yet. We do not have standard definitions, objective measures, systematic indicators of progress."

### 5. The SF Anti-Humanism (Complexity: 4 → ELI20)
*   **The Logic**: Connor recounts conversations in SF: a guy who doesn't care about existing children because counterfactual non-sentient beings matter more; a girl who thinks humanism means wanting to live in human bodies forever. These people literally do not understand human values. They're in bad social circles with antihumanist ideologies.
*   **Concrete Example**: "After that a San Franciscan girl comes to me and says 'Oh humanism, is this the thing where people want to live in human bodies forever?' This is basically the understanding of humanism in a lot of those circles."
