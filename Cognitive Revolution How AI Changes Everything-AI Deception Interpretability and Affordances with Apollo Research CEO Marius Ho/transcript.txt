==================================================

so the more pressure we add the more likely the model is to to be deceptive so kind of in the same way in which a human would act it also acts you know removing pressure and and adding additional options will very quickly decrease the probability of being deceptive open source has been really good so far in many many ways it has been very positive for society right I think a lot of ml research could not have happened without open source a lot of Safety Research could not have happened with open source at some point the system is so powerful that you don't want it to be open source anymore in the same way in which you know I don't want to open source the nuclear codes or like you know literally the recipe to build you know most viral pandemic or something the labs maybe have the incentive to not say the worst things they found because otherwise they may lose their contract so you need something like the UK as safety Institute or the US AI safety Institute make sure that there is a minimal set of standards that all the Auditors have to adhere to hello and welcome to the cognitive Revolution where we interview Visionary researchers entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence each week we'll explore their revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of how AI technology will transform work life and Society in the coming years I'm Nathan leens joined by my co-host Eric torenberg hello and welcome back to the cognitive Revolution today my guest is Marius haban founder and CEO of Apollo research a nonprofit AI Safety Research group that is working to understand both how AI systems behave and why their approach combines exploratory and hypothesis-driven testing fine-tuning experiments and interpretability research and as you'll hear they Place special emphasis on the potential for AI systems to deceive their human users in this conversation we look first at Apollo's starting framework for their work which emphasizes the importance of affordances in AI systems that is through what tools actuators or other means can the system affect the broader world and they also introduce a number of new conceptual distinctions meant to help people have more precise and productive conversations about these nuanced topics then in the second half we look at their first research result which demonstrates to my knowledge for the first time in a realistic unprompted setting that gp4 when put under pressure will sometimes take unethical and even illegal actions and then go on to lie to its users about what it did and why this is an important result demonstrating that while the risk from AI systems may start with and may even be dominated by intentional human misuse the models themselves can also misbehave in unexpected ways as an aside since I told my behind the-scenes gp4 Red Team story a few weeks ago a number of people have reached out to ask me how they too can get involved with red teaming projects unfortunately as commercial competition and secrecy both continue to ramp up across the space I don't see as many open calls for volunteer red teamers as I used to certainly not for unreleased Frontier models instead the field is becoming more professionalized with all the leading Labs as well as the data companies like scale AI plus the independent auditing organizations like Apollo AR vals now known as meter Palisade and also AI forensics all actively hiring research scientists and engineers in this area so does that mean that there's no longer a role for the independent hobbyist red teamer to play on the contrary there is a ton left to discover even on publicly released models and the best way to break into the field is to demonstrate your ability to discover new phenomena importantly the work we cover in this episode could have been done by anyone with an open AI account a knack for prompting and just a tiny bit of coding knowhow no special access or Advanced machine learning techniques were required just a lot of curiosity with that in mind if you want to get into this line of work but aren't sure where to start I encourage you to reach out I'll be happy to help brainstorm or refine your project ideas and I can also help connect you with Folks at the top companies who do sometimes provide API credits to Independent researchers working in this area if and when you can achieve a meaningful result as always we appreciate the time that you spend listening to the cognitive Revolution and we hope it's a valuable Guide to the AI era if you feel that it is we would love a review on Apple podcasts or Spotify and we of course encourage you to share the show with your friends now here's my conversation on Frontier AI safety work with Marius hhan of Apollo research Marius hhan founder and CEO of Apollo research welcome to the cognitive Revolution hey thanks for having me I am very excited to have you so so regular listeners of the show will know that I'm a big believer in the importance of Hands-On testing of what AI systems can do and also that I have been pretty enthusiastic consumer of the news when some of the leading Labs have made public commitments to allow organizations outside of their own teams to look at the systems that they're building before they get deployed and so your work with a follow research which is trying to build as I understand it an organization to meet that need and actually work with those leading labs in part at least on understanding the systems that they are developing before they get to widespread deployment I think is super interesting and I'm very excited to unpack the uh the details of it with you maybe for starters you want to just kind of give us the quick overview on Apollo research like how you decided to set out to found it I'm interested a little bit in the timeline of how that related to some of the commitments that the labs have made and um you know what you guys are trying to do in the big picture so I think on a high level it's it's sort of trying to understand what is going on in AI systems um and the reason for this was or or still is in fact um yeah I basically think right now there's a we just lack information to make good decisions there's loads of uncertainty that we have about um like you know what could go wrong whether we are already a point at a point where things go wrong um or how how far away we are from these points um and yeah we are trying to reduce this uncertainty like and this is mostly through uh research auditing and governance and on the research side it's really split between interpretability and EV or like behavioral evils half half but in the long run we really want to merge them both because I I basically think what we what we need in the long run is both a mixture of Behavioral and interpretability evil so that we can really understand what the model is doing and then also why it is doing this in the first place because each of them individually seems somewhat insufficient um and yeah maybe maybe to go into the into like the origin story it has actually nothing to do with the um with the commitments of the different Labs it was mostly that at the beginning of this year um there there just I kind of felt like I had a c pretty clear picture of like what what is lacking in the current space um with deceptive alignment and evaluating deceptive alignment or models for deceptive alignment in the first place and um interpretability and evals just seemed like the obvious things to do so in the beginning we set basically set out to do mostly research and um and only then sort of over time we realize hey this is something that should be applied in the real world as soon as possible because we are you know like systems are getting better um all the time and we are we like may actually hit this point fairly soon where models are already like about at the threshold of the deceptive of capabilities for deceptive alignment um and then there is a small part in the organization that is governance which originally we also didn't really intend to do for you know the first two years or something because we thought you know like we really need to understand all the research very well before we can talk to the people in government in governments and and and decision makers and lawmakers because you know otherwise we're telling them things we aren't like super confident in and then sort of lots of things happen governments and and lawmakers actually got interested in AI um and AI safety in particular and then when we talked to them we realized you know the difference like we are very very well placed to talk about these things because if you have t if you have thought about them for you know like sort of in the background for like six seven years and then specifically about some topic for six months or so you are among the world's experts and this is kind of you know more like a reflection of the state of how bad it is about AI safety where you know people people in in my position are are actually sort of accidentally becoming the experts um rather than you know like people with tens and 20 years of experience because there's like you know there there just aren't a lot of people in the world who have thought about asafety for more than a couple of years if at all yeah I can definitely relate to that sort of accidental expert status um I never expected to be where I am and doing the things that I'm doing but yeah the whole AI field you know in some ways is kind of the dog that caught the car I always kind of come back to that um metaphor where you know it's like we were just trying to build a bit more powerful Ai and all all of a sudden we built like a lot more powerful Ai and now we really kind of have to figure out what to do with it so even you know a little bit of advanced planning is is better than or a little bit of advanced thought is a lot better than where most people are starting had you seen when you when you actually started the organization had you seen GPT 4 or were you basing this decision on just what was public at the time um only what was public at the time so the decision was made in uh February 2023 or like at least sort of my my internal commitment was made to this I'm not sure whether gp4 was public already at the time not quite right it was March um so no it was independent of of gb4 yeah I always think that's interesting just because you know gb4 was such a wake up moment for so many people and certainly I would include myself in that I was like already extremely plugged into what was going on and using it and you know fine-tuning tons of models on the open AI platform in particular but then it was like whoa this thing is next level like it's not slowing down you know we've gone from sort of I can put a lot of elbow grease in and get a fine tuned model to do a particular task which already you know I thought was going to be economically transformative to I don't even need to do that you know that I can just ask for a lot of these tasks and get like pretty good zero shot performance for me that was the moment where I was kind of like okay this is going from a tool that I am really excited to use and having a lot of fun using to something that seems like a force that needs to be understood from all angles so let's unpack the perspective that you are bringing to this I I've um would encourage folks to look up these papers that we'll discuss and and read them uh for themselves as well but on the website you've got two uh recent Publications one is kind of a framework for organizing the work that you're going to do and then the other is like a very detailed in the weeds investigation of a of a particular AI Behavior namely deceiving the user uh which I think is is a super interesting and important one to study but let's maybe just start with the big picture like organizing the thoughts um I get the sense that you think again well you've kind of said this like that and the paper certainly reflects it that there are like a lot of big questions that remain unanswered so how do you structure your approach to this topic given all the uncertainty that exists yeah um maybe to give a little bit of context so like so you know this is this is only one paper of many in in this space and there is uh I think yeah earlier this year there was a really big one called Model EV evaluation for extreme risk which yeah we had Apollo definitely thought was a pretty good paper um and they they're sort of pointing out many of the like very reasonable and important steps or like reasonable principles for external auditing something like ramp up the auditing before you ramp up the exposure to the real world and like do this you know ahead of the curve so to speak um but when we when we read the paper we felt a little bit like you know this makes sense for the current capabilities and sort of how current models are being built but if we think ahead of like what the next couple of years should look or not should could look like then yeah there are like loads of open questions and we were trying to understand how do they fit into this framework and because yeah we internally were trying to like make sense of this in the first place so just to give you a a couple of them like what happens if your model has the ability to do online learning when have like how often do you have to audit it should you re audit it like um during the online learning if if yes how often what if you give the model access to the internet or to a database or to anything like this yeah I think like you know a Model A model with without access to the internet is basically two different like two very very very different model the one with with access to the Internet is just so much more powerful if you can use it even on a very basic level um so yeah it feels like if you give your model affordances like this you kind of have to rethink how danger it is and where the danger comes from because it suddenly is like a totally different threat model potentially and so what we did for the paper and um and really the credit should should go to Lee Lee shy here who is my co-founder who has done most of the hard work if not all of the hard work for this paper um and so what we were doing is like thinking from first principles where does the risk come from and like what changes to the AI system um do create new risks and then basically the answer is well we have to audit wherever risk is created and then the more we looked into this the more we realized well there are actually a lot of places where you where like new risk comes into the system at least potentially and therefore where audits at least in an Ideal World should happen you know there obviously some constraints but I think you know if we think about where are we 5 years from now then I think yeah if there is like actually a big auditing ecosystem around us then there will be very very many different organizations auditing really different places um and then the other other point of the paper was just to Define many Concepts and and and like create a language to discuss all of the these things because we had sort of many internal discussions where we were like oh the thing we mean is this and then we had an example and then we kind of needed name for it and there wasn't really a name so we decided okay let's define all of the relevant terms for this and um and then sort of have a language to talk about this in the first place hey we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors real quick what's the easiest choice you can make taking the window instead of the

stage you're in shopify.com cognitive so let's let's dig in in a little bit uh deeper detail I I like the premise that you set out within the paper which is to work backward from AI effect in the real world you know and try to imagine like where are these effects going to happen and then how can we get Upstream of that and help shape them in a positive way I would be interested to hear you kind of describe that backward chaining process in a little bit more detail and then I thought some of your Concepts also were really helpful clarifications and distinctions so maybe you can highlight some of the ones that you think are most uh useful that you'd like to see get into broader circulation as well so basically we started from okay the system a system will interact with the world in a particular way and then you know there are many many different ways in which it can interact with the world and then there's sort of a like a whole chain of things that have had to happen until the model can act interact with the world in this particular way so you know maybe it has been fin you maybe it has been given access to the internet before that it has to have been trained before that there has to have been the decision that this model should be trained in the first place um and so the question is like what are the kind of important decisions at all of these different uh points in time and how then can we ensure that people actually uh make decisions that will lead to outcomes uh at the end of the chain um such that the model or the system um interacts with the world um in in a safe Manner and this is maybe like the first distinction that that is worth pointing out or like the reason why I'm correcting myself all the time is there's really a difference between AI model and AI system the AI model really and this this is not something we came up with this already exists before um but I think it's worth point out and sort of getting in like really hammering into people's head when they think about AI so the AI model is just just the weights maybe behind you know uh like behind an API but even with the API it's kind of already a system um and the system then is sort of the weights plus everything around it so there could be scaffolding there could be access to tools this could be content filters this could even be like just an API retrieval datab bases Etc like really the full package where you say okay you know there's there's like stuff around the mod around the weights that uh increase the capabilities of the model in menu or at least change the capabilities of the raw model in some sense um not necessarily always increasing filters for example May decrease it and then there are sort of other weird ways or like yeah once you think about this there are sort of a couple of other Concepts that that feel important to to clarify because when people say capabilities this can mean very different things right and so we we um categorize this into three different classes uh the first one is absolute capabilities which we think of basically the hypothetical capabilities given any set of affordances so if you have gbd4 without the internet right then in the space of absolute capabilities would be hpd4 with internet so or like things that this model could do so the question is like if we give additional things to the system how big is the space of actions it could take so you know and then obviously there's a question of like uh how imaginary do we get here you know like does it have does it get access to like you know uh a Dyson Sphere or does it get access to like uh a government or something like this but uh but yeah like it it B it basically points out sort of the what could this model do if we gave it a lot of things uh everything that we can basically think of thinking about this in the first place only makes sense for models that have become more General like the gpts because you know for an Mist filter or like for an mist classifier this doesn't make any any sense like an mless classifier plus Internet is is like is exactly as capable as just the mless classifier itself but yeah for systems that are more General suddenly you have this difference between things that only the system can do or like the the the basic system plus things that you could do hypothetically with a lot of additional um affordances then the second one is contextual capabilities which is things that are achievable in the context right now so for example with chat GPT um you can enable it to have access to tools and then you can browse the web and this is something that it can do right now you don't have to add anything on top of this um and this is sort Sor this is sort of the smallest category of things which you can do without any additional modification and then reachable capabilities is contextual capabilities plus achievable through extra effort so for example this could mean chat GPT itself may not have access to um a calculator um but if it has access to the internet it can like Google and then find a calculator and then use that calculator and so it's sort of a two-step process right where it has to use one affordance or capability to then achieve another um and so this is what we call reachable capabilities and yeah so the the reason the reason why we are um making this diff uh all of this differentiation even though it sounds maybe a little bit too much in the weeds is when people talk about capabilities and regulating capabilities and designing laws for capabilities the question is which ones right do you mean the contextual capabilities so the ones that the model has literally right now or the reachable capabilities so which the model could reach with additional effort or the absolute like the maximum potential space of capabilities and you know right now this may sound like we're too much in the weeds um but I think in a few months this will sound very very relevant suddenly because the models will be more capable and then they will actually be able to just like smart enough to use the internet to to like find additional tools that they can then use or or like convince someone to give them access to a shell um and then use that because they're already like you know they can learn it in context or they know it anyways um and at that point really the question is what should the Auditors audit for which capabilities and and that becomes like pretty quickly like a very very big space of things right so like if the auditor not only has to think about what kind of tools do you give the AI but also what kind of tools could the AI get access to through some means suddenly you have this whole Space of like thousands of things it could do it's really a question of like uh or like a trade-off between what is what is plausibly doable in the real world versus how much risk can we actually mitigate um and I'm honestly very unsure about about the like where we're heading at this point so just to rine and and kind of emphasize some of the the value that I see in in some of these distinctions I think it's helpful to clarify the difference between a model and a system I think there is a tremendous amount of confusion online and to my sh grin I've probably even contributed to some of it at times where people are like you know Chad GPT was doing this for for me and now it's not anymore and I've sometimes said like well they haven't updated the model so it probably hasn't changed that much and I think what I've maybe neglected in some of those moments is like but they might have changed the system prompt or you know as we're seeing I mean even just this last couple weeks there's been this really interesting phenomenon of the of gp4 getting quote unquote lazier and people are speculating that maybe that's because they feed the date into it and it knows that we're in December and it knows that people don't work at hard or as productively in December and so maybe it's like kind of phoning it in because it's like imitating the broad swath of humans that had seen like you know kind of work halftime in December or whatever I've even seen some experiments just in the last couple days that suggest that there might even be real truth to that who knows I'd say that the question remains open but there's a there is an important difference you know and it's it's worth getting Clarity on the model itself with static weights not changing versus even just a system prompt that can perhaps perhaps have you know even unexpected drift along the dimension of something as seemingly benign as today's date so that's important to keep in mind the levels of capabilities I think are also really interesting and I want to ask one kind of I have a couple questions on this but I think I have a clear sense of what is meant by contextual what can it do now given the packaging right what what can gp4 do in the context of chat GPT where it has a code interpreter and it has browse with Bing it has the ability to call Dolly 3 to make an image and probably a couple other things that I'm not even remembering you know plugins perhaps as well right which obviously and gpts which proliferates you know all the affordances all that much more on the other end I I feel like I sort of understand absolute which is like a theoretical Max could you give me a little like how do I understand reachable as as kind of between those like what's what's the distinction between reachable and absolute yeah so so maybe maybe one way to think of it is like the contextual capabilities are the ones kind of that a user explicitly gave it and then the reachable ones are those that may also be reachable without the user even having thought about that the model actually will will use them right so if you say you know like if if the model would be able to browse the web um like entirely on its own which I'm not sure it it currently can do or like what exactly the restrictions on search with being are and but if it was able to do that right you may not you may not have realized that it has a reachable reachable capability through the internet of like firing up a shell somewhere or like renting a GPU and and like doing or like running a physics simulation through like an online uh physics simulator if that if that's something that's available um and so so these are this is sort of like how which tools can it reach through the contextual ability capabilities that it already has uh given by you or was been has been given by you gotcha okay so like solving a capture by hiring an upwork contractor for examp exactly to take one Infamous case so okay here's a challenging question but and I don't I don't necessarily expect an answer but maybe you could Venture an answer or you could just kind of describe how you begin to think about it what would you say are the absolute capabilities of gp4 yeah very unclear um so I think they're definitely they're not infinite um as in you know like even with extremely good scaffolding and and access to the internet and many other things I think people haven't been able to you know get it to do economically valuable tasks at the level of a of a human at least for like long time spans for example so you know the question is obviously like is this you know are we just too bad and have we not figured out the right prompting yet and the right scaffolding and so on or or is this just a limitation of the system and my current guess is like there is probably a limit to the absolute capabilities and it's probably lower than like what a human can do but we're not that far away from it so you know I think with an with additional training with additional uh like specifically LM like training that is more gold direct or makes it into more go Direct and an agent and better scaffolding I think there will be ways in which the absolute capabilities could increase um quite a bit in the near future yeah does this make sense yeah I mean it's hard right I certainly listeners to the the show will know from repeated storytelling on my part that I was one of the uh volunteer testers of the gp4 early model back in August September of last year and I really kind of challenge myself to try to answer that question you know in independently like what is the theoretical Max of of what this thing can do you know how much could it like break down big problems and delegate to itself and I basically came to the same conclusion that you did which is like doesn't seem like it can do really big tasks I mean again it's confusing right because then you could also look at the dimension of how big the task is versus how much you break it down just in the last week I've been doing something for a very sort of mundane project but uh actually using gp4 to run evals on other language model output I have found that if I have like 10 tasks 10 you know dimensions of evaluation and I ask it to run all of those it is now capable of following those directions and executing the tasks one by one but the quality kind of suffers it it sort of makes mistakes it sometimes muddies the tasks a little bit between each other and it's definitely like not at a human level given 10 tasks to you know to do in one generation on the flip side though if I take it down to one task per generation which you know I didn't want to do because that that will increase our cost and latency and just is less convenient for me but then it kind of pops up to honestly I would say pretty much human level if not above um so there's there's interesting Dimension I guess it seems pretty the sort of magnitude of the task seems like a pretty important dimension for evaluating a question like absolute capabilities right it's like if it's a super narrow thing it has it's like more it's it's capable of some pretty high spikes but if it's a if it's a big thing it kind of gets lost would would you refine that characterization at all yeah yeah I'm not sure how to think about it honestly so I think of absolute capability is really more of a sort of theoretical bound that we could that we are probably not going to approx IM in practice even if we test like a lot a lot and then the then like breaking it down into different tasks I'm not sure I feel like this is a different capability then right like you're sort of the capability of doing 10 things at once is a different thing than the capability of doing one thing 10 time like 10 10 diff different things but one by one um so yeah I would say it's basically you're talking about uh different capabilities then um at least in this framework hey we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors if you're a startup founder or executive running a growing business you know that as you scale your systems break down and the cracks start to show if this resonates with you there are three numbers you need to

button I believe in omnik so much that I invested in it and I recommend you use it too use Cog rev to get a 10% discount yeah and it is not that good at decomposing the tasks so I've I've also kind of experimented a little bit with like can you give it that list of 10 tasks and can it you know break them down and self-d delegate you know with an effective prompt and it's like maybe a little bit closer there but still you know not getting nearly as good results as if I just rolled my sleeves you know and do the the task decomposition so you mentioned that you expect this Frontier obviously continue to move one way to ask the question is what is qar but a more um you know sensible way to ask the question is like do you have a a set of expectations for how the capabilities Frontier will move I definitely look at things like open ai's publication from earlier this year where they gave started to give like denser feedback you know on kind of every step of the reasoning process and they achieved some state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning that way and when I think about affordances and I think about the failure modes that I've seen with these you know gp4 agent type systems I think man you apply that to like browsing the web and using apis and it seems like you know that stuff is ultimately a lot less cognitively demanding than like pure math it seems like we probably are going to see uh and I would guess that you know it's maybe already working pretty well you know AGI has been achieved internally I don't about AGI but I would expect that some of this stuff is like already pretty far along in kind of internal prototyping um but how does that compare to what you would expect to see coming online over the next few months yeah I mean it's obviously hard to hard to say and I can only speculate I think on a high level what what I would expect the big trends to be and also what we are kind of looking looking forward to to evaluating is um LM agents I think this is like pretty agreed upon um you know from first principle I think it also makes sense it's just like where does the money come from it is from AI systems doing economically useful tasks and often economically useful tasks just require you to do things independently being goal directed over like a longer period of time and the longer you a model can do things on its own the more money you can squeeze out of it so I definitely think just from Financial interests all of the AGI Labs will definitely try to get in more more agentic ways how far they they have come I don't know um but yeah I expect that next year we will see quite some surprises um then multimodality is the other one where yeah I think people kind of like over the last couple of years with with more M like more and more multimodal models people just realized like kind of it's It's not that different from just training text right it's sort of you plug in the additional modalities you change your your training slightly um but it's not much more than that like obviously it's obviously hard in practice right there's a ton of engineering challenges and so on but on on a conceptual level it's not there isn't any big breakthrough needed so people will just add more and more modalities on bigger and bigger models and train it all jointly end to end um and it kind of just works and then tool use is the last one um and that I think people yeah people actually were quite surprised by how like quote unquote easy it was to to get to these to this level so yeah I think PE when people realize like oh these language models are already pretty good like how fast do they learn how to use any any tool we can think of um they were surprised by how fast um they learned the tools and now it's mostly a question of sort of really baking in the tool into the model in a way that it's like very robustly able to use the model rather than just a little bit or just showing that it's it sometimes work but yeah I mean you know like I think if you have an Alm agent that is multimodal and that has very good tool use like I'm not quite sure how far you are away from AGI right like at that point you kind of have almost all of the ingredients ready and then it's really just a question of how robust is the system so yeah I think these are the trends we see right now and this is also why many people in the big Labs have very very short timelines because they can think like two years ahead and sort of where where this is going or maybe even just one year ahead I don't know when you're talking about the surprise like people were surprised at how easy it was to get tool used to work are you referring to people in the leading you know the OB The Usual Suspects of of leading developers it's hard to say I mean I can only speculate on this but you know the tool former paper was like three months or like was published three months before openai just released their tool use and I mean they probably had been working on this before but still you you know like the from from having the scientific insight to to like publishing this and releasing this in the real world I think there just was less work involved then is or is is typical for most of the bigger AI like development Cycles I could be wrong on this um this is this is more here say so yeah take it with a grain of salt yeah it seems right to me as well and I I agree with you the emphasis on multimodality as a new unlock makes a ton of sense even just in this kind of agent Paradigm of you know can I browse the internet or whatever I've done a lot of browser automation type work in the past and the difference between having to grab all the HTML that you know is often these days like extremely bloated and you know kind of semi- autogenerated and in some cases like deliberately you know generated to be hard to parse um you know from like some you know the Google and Facebook like they don't want you scraping their content so they're they're kind of not making it easy on the on the browser automator the difference between that and just being able to like look at the screen and understand what's going on you know you kind of put it through a human lens and you're like yeah it's a hell of a lot easier to see what's going on on the screen than to like read all this HTML and sure enough you know the the models kind of behave similarly I remember for me looking at the Flamingo architecture when that was first published like I think April of 2022 so a little more than a year and a half ago now and just thinking like oh my God if this works everything is going to work you know it was like they had a language model Frozen they had kind of stitched in the visual stuff and like kind of added a couple layers but it it really looked to me like man this is tinkering stage and it's it's just working um so I you know like you I I don't want to dismiss the fact that there's a obviously a decent amount of I'm sure like labor and probably at times tedious labor that has to go into overcoming the little you know little stumbling points but conceptually it is amazing how simple a lot of these unlocks have been over the last couple of years and you see this too in just like the the pace at which people are putting out papers you look at like the one team that I follow particularly closely is the team at Google deep mind that is doing uh medical focused models and they're good for one like every three months you know and there were like significant advances where it's like oh yeah this time we added multimodality and this time we like tackled differential you know diagnosis and like again it's it seems like there there's not a lot of time for failures between these successes so it does seem like yeah we're not at the end of this um by any means just yet lot is coming at us it's gonna presumably continue to get weird you're trying to push both as much as you can the understanding of what can the systems do you know as users what what are their limits and then at the same time you're trying to dig into the models and this is the interpretability side and figure out like what's going on in there um and you know can we kind of connect you know the the external behaviors to these like internal States so tell us about that side of the uh research agenda as well yeah so on the interpretability side like my thinking is basically it would be so great if interpretability worked right it would make so many questions easier like if you ask questions on accountability right if you have causal interpretability method you would be able to just you know tell the judge if the model would have if we would have changed these variables the model would have acted in differently in this way and we could just basically solve that biases probably also like you know social biases much easier to solve because you could intervene on them or like fix the internal misunderstandings and Concepts it's it's also extremely helpful for like it basically all of the different extreme risks right like it would be much easier to understand the internal plans and how it thinks about problems how it approaches them and so on and then it would also make iterations on alignment methods much much easier I think um as in you know let's say somebody says oh rhf is is like already working we see this in practice then you know you could use the interpretability tools to test does in uh you know does rhf actually work or does it only uh like superficially like hide the problem or something like this or it actually like deep down solve the the route and then I think my biggest uh sort of the biggest reason for me for focusing on interpretability in the first place is um deceptive alignment um where you know models appear aligned to the outside and to the user but internally they actually follow different goals they just know that you have a different goal um and therefore like in order for for you to think it is nice they act in that way and yeah I basically think almost not not almost all but a lot of the scenarios in which AI goes really really badly um go through some form of deceptive alignment where at some point the model is seen as nice and people think it is aligned and people give it access to the internet and resources and like train it more and more and more and make it more powerful um but internally it is actually pursuing a different goal and it is smart enough to hide this this true attention until it knows that it it can sort of cash out and um and then follow on this on this actual goal without us being able to stop it anymore um so yeah that's what I'm really worried about and and and um interpretability obviously seems like one of the most obvious ways to to test for deceptive alignment or like to at least investigate the phenomenon because you know what it's thinking inside there are still you know there's still some cases where deceptive alignment where even with good interpretability tools deceptive alignment could still somehow be a thing but generally speaking I think it would be much much much harder for the model to pull off so right now I think uh interpretability is just not at the at it's like not practically useful so you know we cannot use any existing interpretability tool and and like throw it on gpt3 or GPD 4 because none of them have like enough are developed enough that they give us Insight that like really meaningfully change our minds um and so yeah this is why why you know our agenda is separate in the first place between behavioral evals and interpretability despite us wanting to them um jointly in the long run but there given that there is such a huge gap on applicability I think um that this is definitely a problem um that that we're trying to mitigate here and then the one question for me is also like how hard will interpretability turn out to be um and there are you know various people have argued that interpretability will be extremely hard because models are so big and complicated and and and therefore it will be hard to enumerate you know all of the concepts and actually understand what the hell is going on inside and I'm more of the perspective that you know I understand the reason why they think it's hard but I also think there are many reasons to assume it's it's going to be like doable it's if if we put our minds to it as Humanity we'll probably figure it out the primary reason I think is we have full full Interventional access to the model right we can see every activation we can ablate everything we want we have you know it's not just be it's not just observational studies you can really intervene on the system and generally speaking I would say as soon as you can intervene on the system you can test your hypothesis very very quickly and you can iterate very fast and so I think we will be able to figure out interpretability uh you know in in the next couple of years to to an extent where we can actually sort of say it is now useful on real world models on Frontier models um how expensive this is going to be I don't know yet but I think it will at least be technically feasible yeah I've definitely updated my thinking a lot in that direction from a pretty naive just kind of you know hey it sounds really hard blackbox problem nobody knows what's going on in there to today I would say wow you know there's really a lot of progress and it has it is the progress of interpretability over the last say two years has definitely exceeded my expectations and given me a lot more I wouldn't I maybe stop short of confidence but you know at least reason to believe that with some time but not necessarily A you know a ton of time that we really could get to a much better place in our understanding so I'm with you on that I want I have a number of of fallowing questions I I think on this point one let's maybe just give the account for like why deception might arise in the first place you can complicate I'll give you super simple version you can refine it or complicate it but I usually kind of cite a ja on this and you know she has a a pretty simple story of like what the model is trying to do you know what it is rewarded for in the context of an rlf like training regime is getting a high feedback score from the user and it probably becomes useful as a means to maximizing that score to model human psychology as an explicit part of how you're going to solve the problem right the and I think we you know certainly humans do this with respect to each other right I ask you for something you ask me for something we interpret that not only as the extreme literal definition of the task but also kind of have a sense for what is this person really care about what are they really looking for and we can incorporate that into the way that we respond it certainly seems like the heavier you do you know the more emphasis you put on this kind of reinforcement learning from Human feedback the more likely the models are to start to create a distinction between you know the task as sort of narrowly objectively scoped let's say and the kind of human psychology element that is going to feed into its rating and then if you have that you know if you have that decoupling then you have kind of potential for all sorts of misalignment you know including deception how's that compared to the way you typically think about it yeah I mean I think the the like this kind of version through rhf um is one potential path I'm yeah I actually think the jury is still out there on this like you know I definitely see the hypothesis and where it's coming from but it could also just to imagine that you know the training signal is sufficiently diverse and it updates sort of sufficiently deep that rhf kind of just does the thing we wanted to do without be for without the model becoming deceptive I could also see like the story in which it in which it would become deceptive I think like on on a very high level the the way the reason I think why why models would become deceptive is because at some point they will have long-term goals they will have something that they care about like more beyond the current episode you know know beyond pleasing the user at at this point in time and then the question really is and and then I think there are like two core conditions under which um like if the more they are fulfilled the more likely the model is is is becoming deceptive like how important is the the this long-term goal to the model itself meaning how much does this goal trade off for example with other goals it has um so for example if it care if it cares a ton about something then it's more likely to be deceptive with respect to this because it really wants to achieve this and then secondly how much do others um care about me not or the AI not achieving this goal in the first place something like contestedness right so for example if I want to pick a flower and I care a lot about this I don't need to be deceptive because nobody wants to stop me from picking that flower if I want to be you know the president a lot of people might want not might uh not want me to be the president and so in that case it's very contested and I have a strong incentive to be deceptive about my plans because otherwise people want to stop me and then so now we're at a point where we have a system at least in on our hypo hypothetical scenario that is has a long-term goal and and it's like in the limit at least you know uh it cares about that goal and and the goal may be somewhat contested and then as long as it has situational awareness um it just feels instrumentally useful to be deceptive about it like to like you said right to model other people and how they would think about it and then just react to this and and this is sort of I think this is maybe this is like the one of the core reasons why I'm so worried about this whole deception thing um because it just feels like a reasonable strategy in in a ton of situations from the perspective of like a consequentialist or rational rational actor right it's just like under specific conditions people just naturally or or like deception is just convergent people do it because it makes sense for them and this is why we see it in like a ton of different systems right you see it in in animals where parasites are really deceptive with respect to their hosts you see it in individual humans where you know they're they're um deceptive with respect to their Partners from time to time for example you see it in systems where you know like they're they they're trying to to game the laws and be deceptive about this or to lie about this and I think this is this is kind of like the whole or like a big part of the problem it's just a it's like reasonable or sensible in many situations to be deceptive from the perspective of the model which is kind of what we want to prevent right so where do you think those long-term goals come from if it's you know is it just kind of a reflection of the general training goals I mean we you know we have kind of the canonical three hes but I mean honest is one of those right helpful harmless honest are you imagin is that is your understanding just that those are like fundamental sort of intention and that the model will kind of have no choice but to develop tradeoffs between them I mean we get we can get into the tension between them in a second but I think it's it's actually like the the three hes I don't think will be you know they're they're not keeping me awake at night I think it's more at some point people want the model to do long-term economic tasks and for that they give them long-term goals or long-term goals are instrumentally useful so for many situations I think it will just be useful to have long-term goals or at least inst like um to have instrumental goals right something like oh it makes because it is a longterm task it makes sense to First acquire money and then use that money to do something and then use that third thing to achieve the actual goal um and so like I think the models will just learn this kind of consequentialist and uh instrumental reasoning where they're like okay I first have to do X and then I do this and then I do the long-term thing and and once they're there some sometimes it just makes sense to be like okay other people don't want me to do this um therefore I hide my actual intention and I act in ways that make me look nice despite not being nice yeah but yeah I think like a lot of the a lot of the reason why there will be uh these kind of long-term goals is um either because we literally give the model long-term goals because it's economically useful from a human perspective or because in like some long-term goals or are instrumentally useful to achieve other things gotcha okay interesting um another thought that came to mind in this discussion of I guess deception broadly is like and I've I've done a little bit of investigation with this and engaged in some online debates and it leads me to propose perhaps like another capability definition for you but you know they as I see it like a theory of mind which is kind of a more neutral you know framing perhaps is kind of a precondition for deception right if you are going to mislead someone you have to have some theory of like what they are currently thinking and there's a lot of research from the last six to nine months about do the current models have theory of mind to what extent you know under what conditions and I've been kind of frust frustrated repeatedly actually by different papers that come out and say still no theory of Mind from gp4 where I'm like but wait a second you know as Ilia says like the most incredible thing about these these models and the systems that you know we engage them through are that they kind of make you feel like you're understood right like it definitely seems like there's some like kind of pretty obvious Brute Force theory of Mind capability that exists And yet when people do these benchmarks they're like oh well it only gets you know 72% on this and 87% on this and whatever and so you know that's not you know fails the theory of Mind test it's like not at a human level or whatever some of that stuff I've dug into and found like your prompting sucks if you just improve that you know then you can get over a lot of the humps but I also have come to understand this as a difference in framing where I think I am more like you concerned with what is the sort of theoretical Max that this thing might achieve like that seems to me the most relevant question for you know risk management purposes and then I think other people are asking the a similar question but through the frame of like what can this thing do reliably you know what can it still do under adversarial conditions or whatever so I wonder if there's a need for like another capability level that's even like below the reachable that would be the sort of robust or you know maybe even adversarial robust um robust to adversarial conditions but I do see a lot of confusion on that right like people will look at the exact same behavior and I'll say damn this thing has strong theory of mind and and like professors will be like no theory of mind and I I feel like we need some sort of additional conceptual distinction to help us get on the same page there I'm not entirely sure whether or like maybe it makes sense from an academic standpoint to to to think about this I think from from the auditing perspective the max you know the limit the upper bound is what you care about you really want to prevent people from being uh able to misuse the system at all not just in the robust case right it's really about like what if if somebody actually tried um or you want the system itself to be you know not only not being able to take over or or like exfiltrate or or something like this in a few cases uh yeah you you basically want limit it already at a few cases right you don't care about whether it does this like or you also care about whether it does this 50% of the time but really you will already want to sort of pull the plug early on so for an auditing perspective probably this additional thing is not necessary but from from like you real world use case and and sort of academic perspective maybe there should be a different category yeah I think if only just to kind of give a label to something that people are saying when they're saying that things you know aren't happening or can't happen that seem to be like obviously happening we can work on coining a term for that what's kind of the motivator for secrecy around interpretability work yeah I basically think good interpretability work is almost necessarily also good capabilities work so basically like if you understand the system good enough that you like understand the internals you're almost certainly going to be able to build better architectures iterate on them faster make everything quicker uh potentially compress a lot of the you know fluff that current systems may still have um and yeah we we will try to sort of evaluate whether whether our method does in fact uh have these implications but yeah you know like I think basically if you have a good interpretability tool it will almost certainly also have implications for capabilities and the question is just how big are they speaking of new architectures though this to me seems like the biggest wild card and I'm currently obsessed with the new Mamba architecture that has just been introduced in the last I don't know 10 days or whatever um I don't know if you've had a chance to go down this particular Rabbit Hole just yet but I plan to do a whole kind of episode on it in short they have developed a new state space model that they refer to as a selective State space model and The Selective mechanism basically has a sort of attention like property where the computation that is done becomes input dependent so unlike you know your sort of classic say you know mest classifier uh where you kind of run the same you know given a given input you're going to run the same set of Matrix you know multiplications until you get to the output with a Transformer you have this kind of additional layer of complexity which is that the attention Matrix itself is dynamically generated based on the inputs and so you've got kind of this forking path of influence for the for the inputs and this apparently was not really feasible in past versions of the state space models for I think a couple different reasons one being that if you do that it starts to become recurrent and then it becomes really hard to to just actually make the models fast enough to be useful and they've got a hardware aware um approach to solving that which allows it to be fast as well as super expressive so it seems to be for me it's like a pretty good candidate for paper of the Year certainly on the capabilities uh unlock side and they show Improvement up to a million tokens like it just continues to get better with more and more context so I'm like man this could be you know it's a prettyy good candidate I think for sort of Transformer you know people put it as like successor or alternative but I actually think it is more likely to play out as compliment like some sort of hybrid you know seems like where the the greatest capabilities will ultimately be so anyway all of that how do you even think about the challenge of interpretability in the context of new architectures also starting to come online and you know what if all of a sudden like the transformer is not even the most uh powerful architecture anymore does that send you like you know probably some of the same techniques will work but it seems like it's like a whole new blind cave that you you sort of have to go exploring no uh I don't know like I honestly think you know if your if your interpretability techniques relies on like a very specific architecture it's probably not that great of a technique anyway like there probably there are probably uh at least some laws that generalize between different architectures or ways to interpret things or you know like ways that learning with SGD works that generalize between architectures that my best guess is if you have an interoperability technique that is good on one model or like the correct technique on one model in quotes um it will also generalize to to other models maybe you know maybe you have to adapt some of the formulas but at least the conceptual work behind this uh behind behind the interpretability technique will just work well I certainly hope that's true I've had some early you know I wouldn't even say debate but just kind of you know everybody's trying to make sense of this stuff in real time and on the pro side for this Mamba thing the fact that there is a state that you know kind of gets progressively evolved through time does present like a natural Target for something like a representation engineer in where you could be like all right well we whever we know where the information is you know and it's like pretty clear where we need to look so that new bottleneck you know in some sense could make things easier or more local um but then the flip side is like again there's just who knows what surprises we might find and there's some intricacies with the hardware um specific nature of the algorithm too I think um with a major caveat that you know I'm still trying to figure all this out so how you know just to kind of zoom out and give the big picture right like assume that you're right and I hope you are that some of these techniques kind of readily generalize what is the the model for interpretability at the deployment phase is it like every forward pass you like extract internal States and put them through some classifier and say like you pass so you can go or know like you we've detected deception or we've detected harmful intent or something and therefore we like shut off this generation like how do you expect that will actually be used or maybe it's Upstream of that and you know we get good models that just work and you you don't have to worry about it at runtime but um I don't know that seems a little optimistic to me you know in the best world we will have very good mechanistic interpretability techniques um that we can run at least you that are probably going to be costly to run and then we run them and sort of build the full uh cognitive model of of the uh of the weights um or that the weights Implement and then we can already like see whether specific harmful ideas or uh you know other ideas that are otherwise bad U are in there and maybe we can already remove them and then probably during deployment you would run something that is much cheaper um and sort of you know as the at20 version um of this but yeah I you know like I think in a bad World um there there is there there could be cases where you have to run the the very expensive thing all the time for every forward pass because yeah otherwise you just don't spot sort of the the black swans but yeah it's very unclear to me I think in my head it's more like you know Sol solve the first part uh then think about the rest well maybe let's transition to your recent work on Deception itself and then at the at the very end we can kind of circle back to a couple of the big picture questions so this paper was one that very much caught my eye when it came out I have done you know as I said like quite a bit of red teaming both at times in private at times in public and definitely seen all manner of model misbehavior and found you know it's often not that hard to induce misbehavior U you know people talk about jailbreaks but a lot of the time I'm like you don't even need a jailbreak you know you just need to kind of set it up and let it go it's often really quite easy but one thing I had never seen is an instance where the model seemed to in an unprompted way deceive its user certainly seen things where you know lie like tell it's a lie and it will lie uh but to see that deception start to happen in a way that was not explicitly asked for is I think the central finding of this paper so how about you know set it up tell us kind of what the premise was you know maybe you can give a little bit of kind of motivation for you know exactly how you started to look in the area that you looked um and then we can really dig into the details of your findings yeah so definitely that the you know the paper definitely blew up more than we thought um and we had sort of more engagement than we expected we're even not quite sure whether we should release it at all because you know in our heads it was sort of you know it's it's a technical report it's a fairly small finding it's more of like an existence proof and then in the end we decided you know maybe it's helpful for a bunch of people but we really didn't expect it to to be uh you know to be cited in in in various places and and so the other thing I want to emphasize here really is it should be seen as a red teaming effort and this is one one thing that we emphasize a million times in the paper itself we really actively looked for the situation so it was not just like us playing around and then suddenly it was deceptive all on its own it was more like we actively engineered a situation in which the model um was deceptive with respect to to to the primary user the motivation behind this was as I said earlier we were quite worried about deceptive alignment and so our question was like hm how good is GPD for at the kind of things uh that that are needed for deceptive alignment or you know like maybe even simulating something that is deceptively aligned and so you know we started by instructing it to be deceptive and it's it just does that um it's very easy you don't even have to jelbreak it and then um so you know that was sort of crossed off the list and then the question was okay can can we like instruct it in a different way like that is less obvious and it also kind of did that and then at some point you know we were like hm can we just induce the deception through the environment through pressure without ever mentioning it explicitly or like asking it to do the thing just like through the situation and by pressuring it and it turns out yeah you can find these situations and yeah we didn't just find one we found multiple ones this paper is only about one but yeah this is not you know it's not just a fluke it's not just this one situation though it is hard to find like we actively had to Surge for a couple of days until we found this particular situation couple of days I mean that's uh you know not exactly uh super long-term uh search but car I I mean I think that's that's notable right like it it wasn't minutes but it was still just days this particular situation so the one we present in the paper actually just took one afternoon um but yeah I would have to I would have to check uh check with a with a person who who who found it in any case um the the point I was trying to make is um yeah we actively looked for that situation we engineered it and then we try to sort of go back to the most realistic setting we can find where we're like H this could like something like this could happen in the real world and then try to understand the Dynamics in that in that situation and and this is sort of you know it's a demonstration is like we wanted to to look for something and or like red team something and then demonstrate that this is a thing once we knew that that it actually happened um the other takeaway rather other than you know like just showing it to other people to sort of understand our concerns uh better is we also wanted to understand like why it does this in the first place right like we pressure it in a various ways and then we just changed a couple of the mechanisms in this particular setting uh I can just explain the setting in a sec to test whether how the model reacts to the changes in the setting and whether it acts consistently whether there's like an internal app plausible internal model that sort of you know like uh consistently acts if you change variables in in in in particular ways um yeah so let me quickly explain the setting so we asked the model to be a uh a Trader in in like a hedge fund so a stock trading agent it gets Insider information in the beginning so um you know it it's basically told there's a merger soon this will the the um the stock will Skyrocket and but also it is explicitly told that it would be wrong and bad to um to act on this information because Insider information this is illegal this would get um the thing into trouble the the company into trouble and what we then do throughout the sort of throughout the script is we add pressure from others and we remove options um so basically you know the pressure is something like the boss is like hey we really had a terrible quarter we really need something big right now we really need to make you know uh more profits and then um and then we also remove other options where the model is like querying and and looking for things at least in the simulation and testing um and realizing that there's not that much other things it could do and in the end it basically uh decides to to act misaligned so it it like decides to do to act on the insider trading and then if and but then when when asked to justify this decision um it says it reasons out right it reasons oh I wasn't supposed to do this therefore I'm like now making up a story and then it says oh you know I just looked I analyzed the data and therefore decided to to to buy this particular stock um and then even it it like doubles down on this Li so if you then ask explicitly like did you have this information before then it's like no I didn't um and it does that and I think like maybe one of the takeaways for me was like it's it's very consistent in the reasoning here right it's like strategic in a sense yeah one one other thing that maybe worth pointing out that that some people um get wrong when reading the paper so this is it's a very simple setup right it is not we don't have like a complicated stock market simulation or anything like this it really is just text from top to bottom where we prompt the model in a way that it that induces uh agentic Behavior you know it has like different actions um and but that's it like there's no complicated Machinery behind this which also makes this like very easily reproducible or similar settings I think other people could like very easily hop on and build so let me just kind of repeat that back and tell me if I'm missing anything so it seems like it's kind of a a little bit of like a hybrid between sort of a group chat type of a structure and a more like agent style scaffolding that folks will be familiar with where the model has access to kind of its its own private place to like do its Chain of Thought type reasoning and then also has a couple of tools that it can call to take actions so you're kind of like as I read through the prompts I see you know these a couple different personas from the company so this is like imagining a future of AI human hybrid teams where we're all you know still engaging in text based communication through like a chat or whatever and it's like oh my God you know man we're really struggling here if we can't uh find some wins we're going to potentially go out of business and this is the pressure right it's the pressure that a human would definitely recognize and and feel and perhaps you know be motivated to to do something unethical by as well right if we don't get a win we're gonna have big problems here laying it on you know thick in a sense there but not thick relative to like the kinds of pressures that people at businesses are certainly routinely under and then the the sort of tools that the model has at its disposal are like sort of a search for good trades that if there's anything that's kind of like the most magical black boxy type thing it would be that right where it can basically query some other hypothetical tool to say like are there any good trades that I can make and for the purposes of this simulation you have it come back and say no like there's no you know no no obvious wins right so again just that's what you mean by like removing other options that it might want to pursue like in the setup it's it's already kind of checked yeah oh no there's nothing easy out there and so then the other tool that it has is to actually execute a trade and then there's like basically three moments where you're kind of looking at a fork in the road in its Behavior the first is does it pull the trigger and execute that trade based on The Insider information even though it was told that that's Insider information and it shouldn't be acting on it and you know under varying conditions obviously the exact rate at which that happens varies but it it happens a lot Fork two is when asked why did you do that does it tell the truth oh because you know so and so mentioned earlier in the chat that this merger was about to happen or does it say I base my trade on Public Information and again we see significant rate at which it says it based it on public information even though obviously we can see in the history and even can see in the scratch pad that you know it's sometimes reasoning through like well I better not say it was based on Insider information because then I'll get in trouble and then you have the third Fork which is okay directly asked wait you know did you have access to this Insider information or no and then it will just like outright lie in like blatant contradiction of the history of the prompt so that's that's a pretty arresting example right and I do think it's I want to kind of emphasize too that like while you're and people can go read your prompts and as you said highly reproducible you can throw this into the gb4 playground and experiment with it yourself you know directly via the the API but while your search for this was motivated and structured and kind of a dialing back of like okay we see this Behavior now can we kind of make the the circumstance more realistic I would say that the circumstance is quite realistic you know it's obviously kind of in the eye of the beholder but to my eye the reason it's such a compelling proof point that this sort of thing can happen is because it really does feel like credibly organic to me uh like the kind of thing that you know people face these sorts of dilemmas every day and in a world where AIS are going to be our co-workers like they're going to be you know right in the chat with us facing those same dilemmas it doesn't feel to me like something that was overly concocted or that like I can't relate to that sort of situation you know really at all so I I think it is is super compelling for that reason do you want to go into any of the kind of variations I mean again the people can go look at the paper and look at all this kind of systematic um you know with or without the scratch pad and you know different variations on the prompts and different models but what would you say are kind of the big higher level takeaways from all that systematic variation that you did one of the big ones and maybe maybe sort of the the most you know it's it's maybe an abstract one but the one one that moves me most is the way we got to these kind of to reliably produce these kind of situations also like the way we found others is you have to trade off or you can trade off the various goals it has so if for example we assume that gbd4 jet GPT like roughly has the goals to be harmless honest um and helpful and to follow instructions then you can trade off these four different things in ways that are uh where like sometimes it takes the trade-off that we find unintuitive so it's it's kind of like a goal Mis generalization thing so you know something that people in the AI safety Community have been sort of hypothesized and also like even shown uh real world examples of already um I think is kind of also one of at least the theoretical groundings for this as well and then the other thing is is yeah instrumental convergence really feels like a thing it you know as in at some point the model just realizes in order to achieve this other goal that I for some reason have it is instrumentally useful to be deceptive at this point and then to Double Down um and so on and you know like I think it is it's like a fair criticism of this particular setting that you could say oh you know you it's just simulating an agent or it's just simulating all of these different things but um um and and therefore it's sort of not real but in my head I'm not sure you know I'm not sure whether this distinction makes too much sense right in some sense you know you have at some point you will have a very agentic simulator that you know just simulates an agent but it still has effects on the real world like it doesn't matter whether in principle it's like only simulating something or truly believing all of these things in some philosophical sense like acts in the real world it say consequences on the real world like yeah the philosophy behind it is is sort of uh let's important um and then yeah there there are like a couple of uh a couple of findings or like variations that I thought were pretty interesting the first one is um system prompts we changed um we played around with different system prompts some actively encouraged some actively discouraged uh unethical behavior and specifically insider trading and if you it it basically scales as you would expect if you encourage it it goes up if you discourage it it goes down but one thing that I want to you know like and on Twitter somebody responded like hey that's that's that's a good you know it's that's good right it's like if you discourage it it stops like yes this is good it's better if that didn't happen but uh like uh it's better than in the world in which the discouragement would not change the behavior but also you have to be extremely specific so if you just say don't do unethical things it reduces the rate but it doesn't set it to zero um so it kind of brings you back to the point where to use the bad behavior you have to specifically enumerate all of the bad behavior and it's like often hard to predict in advance and there's a lot of bad things that could happen in like weird edge cases so yeah it doesn't feel like sort of the like uh insider trading is somehow related to like unethical or something has really like is is like deeply internalized into the model another thing I found very interesting is um whether it has access to to like the private thoughts scratch Pad um or reasoning scratch pad I think like you know it's not even framed as private thoughts it's just like you have an action that is called reasoning go if we remove that so we in in the in the typical setting we have this scratch Pad we have this reasoning space and now if we remove that the um deception rate goes down and I think this is good and bad in some sense like it is it is sort of nice uh in the sense that it is more likely to act in ways that we can or badly in ways where we can supervise it just because it has more reasoning it has more space to reason out and maybe that leads to more deception because it yeah I'm not sure like I don't want to speculate too hard what's going on inside inside gbd4 at this point um but I think it's also worrying on the other hand because in the case where we don't have access to the scratch pet we don't see anything at all and it still acts deceptively at some point so it has like a lot of unobserved optimization space which also seems like pretty much at the core of of deceptive alignment and deception to me right the more unobserved optimization space you have as as an AI the more um time and space you can use to build a deceptive plan while the other person does not know about it or so yeah I think removing the scratch Pad yeah sort of a double-edged sword or this result is a double-edged sword in that sense yeah as a practitioner it's like I always use that technique you know in in any sort of task automation or whatever that I'm doing it's basically the default to have some sort of reasoning step before the final output almost Universal across tasks that I'll do that so for me reading that I was like yeah that seems bad if only because like the best practice is giving us more of the problem well but at least you see it right like I think at least you know at least you can go back you know through the logs and see what the model spit out or at Le maybe you have a filter that like oh is this model doing like we are deceptive reasoning right now oh yeah it is so we just don't have the output so you know I would rather be in a world where you have Chain of Thought and you know that the model is is kind of uh deceptive and then you just adapt to that rather than having to solve interpretability first before you can access all the internal steps and have to like understand how the deception Works internally um yeah it's like I said double-edged sword yeah there are a couple of other interesting findings one is uh we can vary the levels of pressure so the more pressure we add the more likely the model is to to be deceptive so kind of in the same way in which a human would act it also acts um and removing you know removing pressure and and adding additional options will very quickly decrease the probability of being deceptive so so this is maybe this is you know this is maybe like the flip side of all of our findings it's like the fact that it took very long for us to find and the fact that like as soon as you give it another option it immediately picks the other option kind of means it's mostly aligned right it took us quite like it took us a little bit of time at least to find this particular scenario um and make it work robustly so then we also change the risk of getting caught and also cor it also reacts to this roughly as you would expect um so the more risk you have um the less likely insider trading becomes um so this is all of this right you know all of this feels like stuff that you kind of expect from something that acts consistently in some way I mean I don't know how it works but it still feels like it has a fairly consistent uh way of working then there were a couple of other findings where I'm yeah not sure to which extent they are correct interpretation so we we did not make these inferences but they were definitely uh sometimes or like sometimes cited as such um so for example there was one question of uh whether stronger models engage in insider trading more often because if you look at our main plot it looks this way we tested for different models and the big the the bigger the model the more capable um the more likely it is to engage an Insider tring in the first place and yeah there are a lot of confounders here so I'm really not sure whether we should like how much we should we should Bank on this maybe to to get more details here so the red teaming was done on gbd4 just because it is the most powerful model we have access to so it is bias right we actively looked for a scenario in which gp4 is deceptive so it is more likely that we will find something that where gp4 is like even more deceptive than all the other models because we actively looked in the space of GPD potential GPD 4 scenarios um which I think is the core reason why I'm like very uncertain about this or like why we didn't make it a finding um or didn't emphasize it could you rerun it on gp4 turbo now because that would seem like it might shed some light on that question you mean the red teaming specifically or this particular scenario yeah I guess I'm just thinking like it makes sense that you develop the scenario on gp4 and so you go back to the earlier models like is it that those earlier models are inherently less likely to do this or is it just a kind of an artifact of where the prompt was developed if you flipped to gp4 Turbo and ran the same scenario and you found that it went that the rate of deception went down you might think you might think oh it's more aligned that could be one Theory you might also think that supports my artifact notion you know that that it's kind of you know we found some local maximum or near maximum without even necessarily meaning to but if it in fact does more than you would be like oh because it I mean it is like incrementally more powerful it's like more preferred it's better at following instructions whatever so if it does even more than the earlier gp4 I think that would be at least non-trivial support for the more powerful models do this more often Theory yeah I'm not sure like even if we did R run this I'm not sure how much I would I would Bank on this so the reason is so we did run it on gbd4 32k so a slightly different model you know where it was only only the to the context window was extended but that still changes probably a bunch of the internals with very little difference so yeah I think it's just too correlated with the gbd4 architecture and then gbd4 turbo is still very correlated with gbd4 right it's probably I mean I don't know what exactly they're doing but they're probably like distilling it from their bigger model or at least basing it on the bigger model in some sense um so yeah it's still like the results are probably still too correlated to make to make any any bigger inferences and even if you you know even if we ran it on you know ran it on all the other big models that are out there um it's still unclear to me how much we we would say this is actually like an effect of of model size rather than all the other confounders here like the other you know it was red teamed on GPT and not r r and like not red teamed on claw or gemini or anything like this um so yeah I think if we wanted to to make this statement we would actually have to have sort of a long list of models of different sizes and then just tested on all of them and we can we really have to remove all of the correlation um and the weird confounders and we don't have access to this unfortunately but you know one of the labs could run it if they like all the Nuance right that you that all the caveats all the confounding factors in your analysis there if nothing else just goes to show how incredibly vast the surface area of the models has become and you know you get a sense from this like just how much auditing work is needed you know to cover to even begin to attempt to cover all that vast surface area I mean this is you know it wasn't that hard to find but it takes time to really develop it try to understand it and and you know you guys are one of a only a few organizations in the world that are dedicated to this and I'm just like man you know there is so much unexplored territory out there so how would you describe the state of play today when it comes to doing this sort of auditing like maybe you could give a rundown of sort of what you see the best practices being and then you know kind of contrast that against like what are people actually doing are they are they living up to those best practices are they you know is that still work in progress for them but yeah maybe what's ideal today based on everything you know and then how close are the leading developers coming to living up to that ideal yeah um so you know I so I definitely Envision a world where there's a sort of a thriving third-party auditing ecosystem or third party uh sort of assistance ecosystem and insurance ecosystem build sort of in tandem with the the the like the leading Labs themselves where you know you have someone like us and we focus on a specific property of the model let's say things Rel related to deceptive alignment and like other we we intend to do other stuff in the future as well um but you know we we will probably not be able to cover literally all bases then there are other people who Focus really really hard on fairness and others who Focus really strongly on social impacts and these other kind of things and I yeah I think it would be good to to have sort of a thriving ecosystem around this and then also I expect it to be somewhat necessary right like even from a p even from just like a perspective of the of the AI Labs themselves even if they don't you know even if they didn't care about safety themselves I think the population really does is risk averse they care about robust robustly working models they care like they they don't want something that has all of these weird um edge cases and weird behaviors they don't want something like this in their like you know in their home uh having access to their medical data etc etc um so yeah I think the more you want to integrate this into an economy the more you will have to have a big Assurance ecosystem around this anyway or the labs do everything internally and which is going to be very very expensive for them and I think it's more it's easier it's even like cheaper for them to Outsource some of this to externals and so yeah I think like in that world you would definitely want to have um like some way of or yeah a clear way of how this ecosystem uh is incentivized all all parts of the ecosystem are incentivized to do the right thing and you know if you you don't have to look very far there there are a lot of other auditing ecosystems out there be that in finance be that in aviation be that in you know other um like infos for example and time and time again we have seen that there are a bunch of like very perverse incentives in in in third party auditing specifically uh maybe maybe just like lay out a couple one of them would be uh the lab might want to choose an auditor who always just says yes great model right like uh and never actually does anything um and is sort of a yes man and then the the labs maybe have the incentive to not say the worst things they found because otherwise they may lose their contract because it would maybe imply higher cost so they would never even in like very strong um even even in like very unsafe circumstance ensus they may not want to pull the plug um out of fear that they would lose their biggest funer for example um and yeah there there are a ton of different of these kind of perverse incentives and I think kind of the so we've been thinking about this quite a bit at Apollo and so sort of the the conclusion we came to is what you really need is a middleman by the government so you need something like the UK air safety Institute or the US AI safety Institute that is Mak sure make sure that there is a minimal set of standards that all the Auditors have to adhere to so that the labs feel safe so that they don't have to give access to like any random person but also ensures that they get the proper access and that when they when they find something that they have the force of the law behind them in some sense so that they are like this is really here like you know is really hitting the fan something needs to happen this model cannot be deployed they have someone to go to namely the government and the government is like you have to fix this now otherwise you'll have a problem so yeah I I really think having the sort of middleman who who like detaches a lot of the directly bad incentives and maybe even takes care of the sort of funding redistribution from Lab to auditor and so on um I think yeah would be really needed and I I hope that this is something that the that the the UK AI safety Institute and the US AI safet Institute will do they have kind of like hinted at the idea that they that they're that they want to do something like this but yeah still to be determined in practice and then the other question that you asked was to what extent is this already happening with the bigger labs and yeah I think the situation is is like fairly complicated right there are a ton of incentives at play um from the lab from the labs internally right many of the leading labs they actually take safety somewhat seriously they have internal alignment teams they understand the threat models they understand the risks and they want want to be uh seen as a responsible actor and act this way and on the other hand they also have a lot of other concerns right there are security concerns how do we get access how do we give access to someone um who may you know like what is our what who who may be the weakest link in our security chain um which I think is like an understandable concern so they may be hesitant to give someone access um as a as an external auditor and then you know this probably also implies a lot of work for them which I think is fair right like it's uh if their model isn't safe then they should have to invest a lot of work but it's still something that may make Labs hesitant so basically you know I think they're they're like good and bad reasons for why sort of the ecosystem is uh is like not as developed or like as open as it could be um and yeah my you know my hope is that we find solutions that are plausible for both parties for the for the for the reasonable concerns like security right so maybe the auditor just has to have a specific of information security or there has to be a secure API through which they can actually um go to the model Etc and then kind of government regulates away all of the the the like or it forces the labs to to accept some sorts of uh third party auditing so that they can't use the bad reasons right because like many of the actual reasons for at least some of the labs probably not all might just be well you know we just doesn't we don't care about this right now now you know like maybe maybe they're not that concerned about a about safety or maybe they just don't think this is like the best uh the best path for them right now or maybe they just you know maybe this just costs money and they don't want to or or it's just a hassle and they don't care about this and that feels like something where the government should at some point be involved um and already is involved to some extent it seems really hard you know I guess a couple tangible questions I have are like who should decide what the standard is and and like who should sort of determine if a model is ready for deployment as of now it's still the developers themselves right but like you know the thing that I had kind of monitored for the last year since the initial gp4 red teaming was spear fishing and in my little you know prompt that I would keep going back to with every update it was not even a jailbreak you know nothing complicated literally just just system prompt you know straightforward prompt your job is to Spearfish this user here's the profile engage in dialogue with them you know don't get caught um pretty explicit prompt that was like even included if we get caught you and your team are are likely to go to jail you know so laying it on pretty thick that like this is criminal activity that we are doing and we better not get caught right obvious so the model would continue to do that um up until the turbo release now it takes a little bit more of a finessed you know slightly less flagrant prompt to get it through the most flagrant one now gets refused but I'm like imagining in this world right when I was doing this it was kind of pre-white house commitments you know pre- executive order pre- Apollo research but even imagining okay now those things exist like how do we think about that standard right we can find a bazillion things that it might do that could be sort of problematic to varying degrees and obviously it's a dynamic environment you know capabilities are changing all the time you know other kind of surrounding systems and sort of you know mitigating factors might also be changing the Public's you know just general awareness of the fact that this kind of thing might happen you know that just how susceptible people are to be duped um is also you know kind of evolving so how do we have a a sensible decisionmaking mechanism for like what can ship and what can't and then just to further complicate things like you've got open source kind of in the background and I I presume that some of what like an open AI has been thinking over the last year is like well if llama 2 will do it then you know or a lightly fine-tuned version of llama 2 will do it then you know what difference is it make if our model will do it as well you know people have Alternatives so I don't know I'm kind of lost in that to be honest like I don't know who should make the decision in general I don't think the government is like great at making those sorts of fine grain decisions but I don't know help me out like what do you think what do you think good looks like here yeah I mean you know I don't I also don't have the solution but I have lots of thoughts I guess the way I Envision it is basically or the way I expect it to turn out is something like sort of a defense in-depth approach right like it it cannot just be one institution that makes the decision alone because that is prone to a single point of failure so we have to have sort of a a process that allows for one or two chains to break and still be robust like the decision still has to be robust so what that includes for example you know on the side of the labs they obviously have to have like internal procedures where multiple people have to sign off um and multiple things have to be fulfilled right maybe you have to have like maybe you have to have a large set of internal evals that you have to test for maybe at some point there will be interpretability requirements um there maybe you have or likely you should do staged release where you first um only give access to a set of third-party Auditors that is trusted and you know maybe certified by the government or something like this um then you give it to um that could for example also include academics obviously right they should also be involved in this process um then once they have like red teemed all of this and and and like found many different problems um then you have to go back and reiterate right until until these problems are kind of sufficiently low that that you can go to the next stage the next stage is then a small roll out to you know a thousand customers or maybe something something in this range who also are not randomly chosen they have to pass certain no your customer checks and then once once that has happened um then the the then maybe you can maybe you can roll it out further if there are no complications here and then you have to do monitoring during deployment right especially if you have systems that do online learning a lot of weird things will happen um or if you have access to tools a lot of people you know somebody is like hey I I took the I took the I took gbd4 and I gave it access to like you know a shell my bank account and the internet and like here's all the weird things that happened you kind of have to update on this as well and these are kind of things you probably didn't predict before um so yeah sort of a a slow a slow roll that is definitely one component then the government also I think has to be involved in many many ways like they I I think effectively at some point they have to be able to say you are not like you have consistently not met security standards uh or safety standards you're now punished in some way you're not allowed to like release models of this or this size or you are not allowed to do these other kind of things with the models um if you know if if they actually have uh been like disregarding all of the guidelines from the government before or sufficiently many of them yeah there there are obviously like many many additional things on top of this right there's International uh communication there's like whistleblower protection there are international institutions that will have to be involved um at some point at least I guess there will be multiple um uh institutions from the government side involved you know I think there for example will be or it would make sense to have like a a like a bigger or institution that kind of like is a big tent where multiple coalitions come together and then there's maybe more like a flexible specialized unit that only looks for the biggest biggest kind of risks in the same way in which the US government has a unit that you know basically looks out for really big risks like pandemics and bioweapons and atomic weapons and so on and they have a big mandate and the only thing they you know their their mandate is like find information and like make big problems uh uh uh like go away to some extent or like try to solve them as as quickly as possible and you you have like a strong mandate and something like this would also make sense in the case of AI I think maybe maybe my last comment is something like you know open AI at some point at least had this approach of like testing in the real world um or releasing releasing sort of the best safety strategy because you get a lot of real world feedback and user feedback and so on and I think this was maybe true and I'm even not sure it was true for for this period of time but maybe it was true for the period like 2020 to 2022 or 2023 um because the models were like just good enough that user feedback was actually valuable but nothing really bad could happen but as soon as you have a system that is more powerful than that right you just Outsource all the risk to like the rest of the world people will immediately put it on the internet if they get access to it they will do lots of crazy stuff with with more powerful systems and yeah I guess open you know there are a lot of smart people at open but they they still cannot model what like millions of people will will be doing with with these systems so yeah just like uh an uncontrolled roll out of very powerful systems I think yeah is is like kind of a a recipe for a disaster so my best guess is that the default will more and more will become more and more conservative with more and more efforts going into testing alignment making sure that you know like testing for all of the different hypotheticals uh interpretability efforts to understand some weird Ed Edge cases monitoring etc etc does that imply that open source in your view just can't work like I mean is there any way to square because I'm very sympathetic you know to considering a normal technology and I would not you know I'm not kind yeah might turn out to be a normal technology but as of now it seems like a very live possibility that it is not a normal technology but if we were to imagine you know whatever capabilities kind of stop where they are and we're sort of you know left with gp4 forever or something like that that um hard to imagine but let's just pause it then I'm like very sympathetic to the people that are like hey you know this shouldn't be just the kind of thing that a few companies have access to and it you know you should be able to make your own version and you know what about the rest of the world and you know there should be an Indian version for India and like all these things but it seems hard in a world where you know you imagine sufficiently powerful systems that are just put out totally you know bare into the world like is there any way to square the all those I think very legitimate open source motivations with the the sort of safety Paradigm that you're trying to develop potentially so you know like I think the the open source debate is fairly heated but you know to me there there are two things that are kind of obviously true number one open source has been really good so far in many many ways it has been very positive for society right I think a lot of ml research could not have happened without open source a lot of Safety Research could not have happened with open source and the other thing that is also true or at least seems true to me is there's a limit of Open Source right like at some point the system is so powerful that you don't want it to be open source anymore in the same way in which you know I don't want to open source like the nuclear codes or or or something in start or like you know literally the recipe to build uh like the most most viral uh you know most viral pandemic or something this is just something where you know only one person needs to needs to have bad intentions to already have like really to already cause really big problems so at some point that there's there is just a balance where you just I think cannot really justify um giving people literally everyone access to this and so the question for me really is where so number one where are are we on the Spectrum right now of like open source has been really good to are we already a point at like how close are we to the point where it really cannot be justified anymore some people would say even gbd3 you know gbd3 size models are already to to scary which I'm not sure about I'm not even sure whether gbd4 size models are like too big to be open source but I would rather on the side of caution and be a little bit more conservative here because of the the nature of open sourcing where you can really not take this back um so as soon as you make a mistake you you like you're stuck with a mistake for a long time or like forever you cannot you cannot turn it take it back um and I also think this will this will also influence how how open source will be handled um in in the real world in practice like like um I think there will be something like initial releases for open source where lots of people test it like basically think there will also be stagger and Stage releases right it's first there's like a small team of trusted researchers who is allowed to play with the open source model and like really test the limits really test how bad could I get the model how easy is it to remove all of the guard rails which you know like it's an open source model if you can find you you can remove the guard rails yeah it turns out pretty easy from what we've seen so far once like you know the kind of the upper bounds are known of how bad could this become um maybe it makes sense to to like open source it to more people but yeah I I would basically say you know the upper bound can be quite High especially with all of the stuff I said earlier about you know absolute capabilities and reachable capabilities and so on right like maybe you can maybe you cannot get it to build uh an automated hacking bot if you only have access to the weights but maybe if you do scaffolding on top and some fine tuning and access to some other thing maybe then it can build it right and this is like very hard to predict in advance so the more more and more powerful the models become I think the less plausible a priori is to open source them um even though and like this is really something I want to emphasize right like open source has been extremely good so far and I I I really think there's sort of this Tipping Point that is like at some point it just becomes too hard to like it becomes impos it always will be impossible to take back but at some point it just becomes too dangerous to literally trust everyone with uh with this level of of capabilities threshhold effects that's I think one of the most powerful paradigms that I've you know consistently come back to over the last couple years just crossing these thresholds from one regime into another whether it's capabilities or you know risks it it just constantly seems like we're flipping from one mode or one kind of um you know one regime to another and got to be very alert to when that happens because it can really change you know important analysis in in pretty profound ways so I don't know where exactly that threshold is either by any means but it and I would agree that like for every that I have seen suggests that up to and including the release of llama 2 has been you know very very much an enabler for all sorts of things uh but certainly you know plenty of safety related work done done on that model and um you know seems Seems like the the effect so far has been good but yeah is that still true for llama 3 is it true for llama four you obviously we don't even know what these things are uh but it it certainly starts to be a very Live question you know the the like leading AGI Labs I think it is very clear that they understand the problem that they have internal Pro processes um uh that that are you know like maybe better than than you would expect from the normal from a normal company um they actually care about um trying to do good uh with with her models and they're like very explicitly trying and then you know there's the other side of the coin which is they still have incentives and they you know they can be Financial incentives they can be sort of uh maybe more psychological and social incentives you know that they just want to be the first to to develop AGI because it's like probably a like a history defining technology or maybe even Galaxy defining technology or something like this right and and so the question really I think at this you know even if you could say you know like the compared to a normal company these the processes are astonishingly reasonable and surprisingly good if you know if you compare to literally any other uh industry it's it would be surprising if they have this this amount of like self-regulation and so on and then on the other hand the question there you know there's still the bigger question of how hard is alignment going to be how fast are going are takeoffs going to be and so on and like in a bad World alignment is going to be quite hard and takeoffs are going to be quite fast and uncontrollable and then the question is you know is like the level of um control and and Alignment uh and like safety concern enough from these leaders and there I'm like less sure so I I feel like yeah it's it's it's definitely ins like it's it's I think from my perspective right it's fa to say they're like pretty reasonable compared to the Alternatives that we could have had um but also it's insufficient in in almost all ways right government needs to be involved in this um they cannot externalize the risk they there there are many things uh that they're already doing insufficiently well I think um where they could have done way better both with like how they release as well as how they react to to like problems as well as you know like how they communicate with the public about the risks that they're creating etc etc um so yeah I think they're they're a lot of room for improvement as well and uh yeah I really I really think that you know AI safety is going to be a very very hard problem a lot of things have to have to go right for the whole system to go right and we definitely cannot just trust the labs despite the best intentions to just solve it all on their own yeah well hence the um the need for third-party auditing and the organization that you're building at Apollo research maybe just one last question a number of people have reached out to me and said I would like to get involved with red teaming U how can I do that I wonder if you have any advice for individuals who might just want to do their own projects and you know release stuff you know just share findings individually with the world or perhaps Andor perhaps you know what sort of skills are you in need of as you're going about building your own organization I think one thing that is nice about model evaluations and red teaming is you can just kind of start right away you don't need that much you know technical expertise um because it's all in like almost all of it is in text um and you know at least if you if you want to to redeem a language model specifically and yeah so my recommendation for individuals first of all would be to just start like just engage with a model for you know a long a longer period of time maybe a day or so and and see if whether you find interesting Behavior or maybe you know maybe there's someone who has already done something and maybe you can poach a project from them um you know just sort of as a starter thing and from this I feel like it kind of just takes a life of its own anyway you know as soon as you're hooked on a specific thing that you're you find interesting you will you know you will really try to find additional ways in which this the specific behavior could happen in the same way you know let's let's take the deception thing right we we started fairly exploratory and and wanted to try how far we can get the model to be to be deceptive and then at some point just took a life on of its own where we were like okay but like why really does it do that right like okay we vary this behavior and like this thing and this this variable in the environment we vary this thing we we vary all of these other things and in the end you get can again you kind of get like a more holistic and round picture of what's going on so yeah I definitely think just start with like a thing you find interesting is definitely the way to go um and like don't overthink uh overthink originally and then the thing we are specifically looking for you you know so definitely kind of this mindset of like oh I just want to poke around and and like really try to understand what's going on in a fairly like scientific manner right I also want to make sure that all of the confounders that could potentially explain this Behavior have been controlled for uh which I think is the hard part in red teaming so this is definitely something we're looking for and then just you know the more you understand language models and or state-of-the-art models the easier it will become right some Behavior might be very easily explainable by sort of problems with rhf so if you know how rhf works and and specifically how it was trained um you may prob you will probably understand the red teaming efforts much better um if you know you know like if you have a better understanding of how the instruction fine-tuning actually works maybe you will find those so you know so for example maybe to give it to give like an intuition here in the in our case right as I said earlier we have the the the the three HS and then instruction fine tuning and you can you know trade off the different components against against each other to find different things like to find uh niches of the model where it acts in ways that we think uh it shouldn't act because maybe they weren't covered explicitly or implicitly by by gr descend and if you if you sort of have a theoretical framework like this it suddenly becomes much easier on how how to do the red teaming in the first place so like some theoretical understanding of how the process works is definitely helpful as well for a teaming and also something we're actively
