# Trust, Safety & Alignment: Cognitive Science Summaries

A curated collection of high-density summaries for important videos, papers, and lectures in AI Trust, Alignment, and Safety, structured using the latest cognitive science research on learning and retention.

## Why This Repo?

The AI safety landscape is evolving rapidly. Keeping up with the latest research from Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI, and independent researchers requires consuming hours of video content. This repository solves that by:

1. **Automated Transcription** - Extract transcripts from YouTube videos instantly
2. **Cognitive Science Summaries** - Summaries designed for optimal learning and retention
3. **Structured Knowledge** - Organized by author/channel for easy navigation

## Summarization Philosophy

Each summary is generated using evidence-based pedagogical techniques:

| Technique | Cognitive Science Principle | Implementation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Mermaid Mindmaps** | Schema Activation | Visual concept maps prime the brain for learning |
| **Inverse ELI Scaling** | Cognitive Load Management | Harder concepts get simpler explanations |
| **Data Tables** | Dual Coding Theory | Visual + verbal encoding doubles retention |
| **Feynman Questions** | Testing Effect | Active recall questions at the end |
| **Curated Resources** | Path to Mastery | Verified links for deeper learning |
